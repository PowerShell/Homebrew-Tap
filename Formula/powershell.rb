  def install
    libexec.install Dir["*"]
    chmod 0555, libexec/"pwsh"
    bin.install_symlink libexec/"pwsh"
  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The executable should already be on PATH so run with `pwsh`. If not, the full path to the executable is:
        #{bin}/pwsh

      Other application files were installed at :
        #{libexec}

      If you also have the Cask installed, you need to run the following to make the formula your default install:
        brew link --overwrite powershell

      If you would like to make PowerShell your default shell, run
        sudo echo '#{bin}/pwsh' >> /etc/shells
        chsh -s #{bin}/pwsh
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_equal "7.1.2",
                 shell_output("#{bin}/pwsh -c '$psversiontable.psversion.tostring()'").strip
  end
end
